Now, here's exactly how to test it in Postman:

For the /batch-ingest endpoint:


Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:8000/batch-ingest
In the Body tab:

Select "form-data"
Add these exact keys:

Copyfiles: [Select File] (Type: File)  // Select your PDF file
email: your.email@example.com (Type: Text)  // Type your email



For the /query endpoint:


Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:8000/query
In the Headers tab:

Add: Content-Type: application/json


In the Body tab:

Select "raw"
Select "JSON" from the dropdown
Enter this exact JSON:



jsonCopy{
    "query": "Your question here",
    "email": "your.email@example.com"
}
Here's a screenshot layout for Postman's PDF upload:
Copy[ POST ] http://localhost:8000/batch-ingest
â””â”€â”€ Body (form-data)
    â”œâ”€â”€ files   ðŸ“Ž [Select Files]  // Key type should be File
    â””â”€â”€ email   your.email@example.com   // Key type should be Text
The files key can be repeated multiple times if you want to upload multiple PDFs at once. Make sure to use exactly the same keys (files and email) as shown above.
